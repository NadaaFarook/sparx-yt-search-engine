Initially it was databases, so that didn't change the understanding of the game as such. But eventually chess playing programs entered the picture unbelievably weak.

So there was no way to say that it was, that it would always win. The trend of humans handing over work to the computer and trying to. So the nature of work started to change. I would initially hand over the basic calculation, then a lot of it, and then this allowed me the possibility to ask also interesting questions. I don't know, let's just try this path. Go down that. So you simulate things that before taking a lot of time to. You would have to find a sparring partner. They would have to understand what you're talking about, and they would. Then you would have to play a lot of games, record these games, analyze them slowly. Now you're able to do all that much faster and use it to. And around about 2006, they started trying very interesting stuff with the software so far. And what they did was at a very early stage, the computer would prune its search tree very, very fast. And this meant that it seemed human like briefly. I mean, this was a phrase which will come up often. It seemed human like briefly, in the sense that it would have these. It would trade complex concepts. So in chess, everything is about the space time. That is how quickly my pieces can get somewhere, the relative value of the pieces and the positioning of the pieces. So if my piece, I have fewer pieces, but they are all in one sector of the board, that sort of thing. And you are just trading these concepts all the time. This generation of machines with very, very interesting ways of using that brute force that they had seemed human like in the way they would seem to go off, almost. The move seemed intuitive to us. Then, once again, a period of consolidation where just very, very good engines come include some of these techniques and they're very strong. Then the first neural, so famously Alphazero. And that was a big leap because there were a couple of. A couple of foundational rules which were rewritten at this point, all the chess playing programs for the first 50 or 60 years of this attempt. So from the university days until the period I'm talking about, which lasted for about 25 years, where programmers writing programs, putting in rules, but based on human games and trying to transfer human understanding as a form of a few basic rules to the computer, Alphazero treaded a new path, which is they programmed the rules of the game, nothing more. They didn't try to explain to it what is the value of a queen or what is the value of a rook. They just gave it the rules. And then I think the stencil chips just played, machines just played 44. The number that's bandied route is 44 million games with itself. And over these 44 million games, it figured out certain rules. It understood very quickly and understood if the queen can do this and it can do this, of course, it's more valuable than the rook, it's more valuable than the knight and the pawn, of course. And very quickly it sorted out the relative values. But then it started to sort out, look, every time the queen's in a dominant position, this happens, or the knight is in this place, this happens. And when the knight is here, when the pawn is here, all these relationships started to build and it then beat the strongest old style chess engine 100 to zero. And that was very big deal. And so subsequently a lot of the best chess playing programs happen on GPU's, so very similar to what's happening in AI. And. Okay, so now to get back to the human side of the story. By this time, the computer that it beat 1000 was beating us 1000. So the gap was getting huge. And it no longer makes sense to compare because when you, when I play one generation of a computer, and I mean a program and another generation, I'm going to lose to both of them. But I have no relative sense of whether I'm doing better or worse than the previous time because you're losing by such a wide margin. It's very hard to understand that, you know, I actually played better this time, but I still lost because the gulf is too big. What we start to do now is to use the computer merely as a training tool. But anyway, to get back to the first part of the human story, now we had a much more realistic sense of where we stood in chess understanding.

In fact, Alphazero confirmed that the human way of playing chess was pretty good. We didn't have the tactical strength, the calculating ability to justify it to a computer, but it was not wrong. And so, you know, if that's a pat on the back for us, it's nice. But the Alvazero's conceptualization of, you know, lots of difficult concepts, chess is quite similar to how we figured it out. But by now, philosophically, no chess player even tries to contradict the computer. And you, you just assume that you don't know the answer. In fact, there are a few significant changes here. Once upon a time, it was thought that the two players who played the game were the best informed about what happened in that game and that all the spectators were merely trying to follow them in their way. By now, it's more or less just an accepted fact, a very basic accepted factor, that the two players who played the game are the least well informed about what happened. But there is one asymmetry. They are the only ones who know what transpired in the game because they are the only ones who felt lack of information. They are calculating the same moves that the spectators are calculating, seeing presented, but they don't know if they're right or wrong. So they're grappling with all that uncertainty. So the players are the only ones who know what transpired under that fog, the fog of war, the uncertainty. But everyone else has a better idea what actually was the correct move. And so once upon a time, people waited for the players to finish, to find out what happened in the game and the player would give them the information. This movie you thought was good. Now the players come to the press conference and say, by the way, what did it say? Did I miss something? And the information goes the other way. It's still.

I started to play in the world championship cycle in the year 1990. I became world champion for the first time in 2000. But then the chess world was divided. There were two titles, a lot of chaos. I got a chance to win the unified title in 2007 and then I had a six year reign till 2013. You know, for me, clearly that was the most important thing. You know, when the career defining goals, career defining dreams, let's say all you get, you take off one by one and it felt great. Then I got to the stage where post world championship, what should I do? The obvious thing is I should continue to compete at the top, play the best tournaments and more of a self challenge. Not because there was something left accomplished. It felt very much like some overtime. But at the same time, I still like the game. And you can't half do a sport, you either all in or you're not. So it was a learning process. I had to find a way to learn new things, suppress my ego, my understanding, and say, if young people are trying these things, well, maybe there's something I don't understand. Let me figure it out. You know, evolve with this very, very fast changing world of chess. And the next few years, I tried to do that. And then a couple of years ago in 2019, I met Sadiq Singhal in Westbridge and we got this idea. I mean, he suggested that we work together. I came up with the idea of an academy, and the first year I selected these four youngsters. Then we added one more, a fifth one, and there was the best girl. We started to have what I thought would be good habits, regular classes, some ideas, how to work. But more and more, me sharing my personal experience, see, the best variations will keep changing all the time now because a new computer will immediately uncover some new stuff. Just knowledge as such is going to keep changing all the time, but just experience more. My experiences from 30 years ago are still relevant when I talk about sitting at the board and facing an opponent and what I go through and things that's going to be relevant 50 years into the future as well. Because with all the training methods, the playing experience hasn't changed significantly. It continues to be so. The idea was for me to work with this thing, and we thought it would be nice, as I transition out of chess, for India to continue to be represented at the top. And of course, we. I mean, certainly not the only reason for these kids to do well. They are wonderful parents, setups, all that. But it feels almost like it's been too successful. And we gotten there very early, because now, after 30 years of undisputed number one, and it's hard to exaggerate just how inconceivable it seemed because there was a hundred point gap sometimes between me and the next. Yeah, recently, Hari came within sniffing distance with it, started to come within, but it just seemed axiomatic that I would be India number one. And suddenly there are four people, all of whom have overtaken me at least once. And, you know, so that's a funny place to be. But anyway, the answer to your question is, I try to keep abreast with developments impossible to be without in such a fast changing era. And I think very similar to what people in all walks of life feel that you can't say, well, this is how we used to do things.

Both are probably key ingredients to why you have continued to be relevant and you found a really good sweet spot now where yourself playing and competing.

Kasparov had already played five matches with Karpov alone, who tried every trick in the book against him. So Caspar had that strengthening. What he also had was growing up with Patvinek and others, interacting with them, and over time, Petroshen, all these people sharing stories of their matches and so on. So he, in that sense, he. Even in his first match, I don't think he was as innocent as I was in my first. It was supposed to be held in Cologne in Germany. Then at some point in June, suddenly they switched to New York and we were going to play in the 107th floor of the World Trade center, obviously a very prestigious venue. But I was informed. I was not consulted. And these sort of things, I didn't think. I didn't see why they needed to consult me. I didn't bother. But these things are important because they provide the stage for where everything is going to happen to you. And if so, if you're not in a role where they've. They're scared or they are worried and they feel that they have to check with you before making any changes, then continuously, people will poke around and. And it affects you eventually. In chess, someone once said that giving up the psychological space is a mistake, because then you're being pushed inward till you only have the chessboard. Whereas if you stand up for everything, again, the question is how much you should stand up and all there is scope for that. But the first match, I was very naive. People had started to tell me, but it's simply a failure of imagination. I couldn't understand why it would play a role. I think you have to feel it. Once Kasparov understood that if you slam the door, you make provocative statements at the press conference while I'm sitting there. You mock a good move while I'm sitting there, that these things sit inside your head and they irritate you and they can affect your play.

In the first match, I used to read chess magazines just to see what was going on. And I picked up one magazine and they had interviewed seven, eight, the best players and said, what are your predictions for the Anand Kasparov match? And this would have been a good moment to flip the page. But I read it anyway, and many of them said things. Some of them were straightforward facts. I mean, Kasparo is more experienced, that's clear. And they valued that highly. And they said, well, I think Kasparov will win, but if you read nine predictions that you're most likely going to lose and then you tell yourself, okay, I don't care. But that's not the same thing as not caring. That's telling yourself. And it's a different act and you have to understand the difference. I think it could have bugged me and it could have influenced me because I was more timid in the approach in the match. And in fact, initially in the match, I'd focused on avoiding failure in the first stretch because I thought if it starts early and I don't feel comfortable yet, and the match starts to go badly, there's no time to recover, which is not a bad strategy. But the way I implemented it was kind of, and it's possible that reading all these things influenced me. So by the same, I played my second match, it was more or less obvious to me that in fact, before the training started, I told my seconds, you read the magazines, you read what's out there. I'm not going to go to any chess website. From now on. You're going to send it the chess material stripped of all the other stuff and you keep it in mind, but don't tell me. And it's your job to, you decide what's relevant and what's not and give it to me in a neutral way so that emotionally. So that was one lesson I took out, but there were many like this, and it's little details. It's realizing that you're very tense right before the game is about to start. And if your car is late, you can't get irritated because then it clouds your judgment. Once the game starts and you go to the board in a slightly irritated thing, you have to tell yourself, these things happen. I mean, there is no global conspiracy to do anything. To me, it's just the car. Another car stood in its way and it's late. You take a deep breath, you try to let go of what you can't control. I mean, positioned under that heading, it looks easy, but it breaks up a lot of little learnings. And so in each match I was able to implement these things better and hopefully I'll be able to convey it to someone so that at least have a starting point.

Before, in the morning, before a game, you're thinking what are all the things that could happen? And you're panicking about all the areas. You feel under prepared and you're visualizing scenarios, but typically at the negative end of it, everything seems to go wrong in your head. So you're wound up. To be honest, I have often found arriving at the boat to be quite a relief, because finally you're dealing with reality. You're dealing with a physical opponent who's probably not going to do some crazy miracles. He's going to play a normal game of chess, he's pretty good, but it's going to be a normal game of chess. And all these scenarios melt away and then you get through the game, it's intense. Invariably you'll exchange mistakes, there'll be missed opportunities, and inside you're still fighting. So for a few hours afterwards there's an echo. You continue to the move that you missed bugs you. The mistake that you made, you know, your head is trying to come to terms with it. And I find these walks useful to settle down. Some of these men thoughts can have almost physical manifestations, like right before I play that movie, you squirm, but the game has long been over, but you feel it physically. And I found that these walks are a good way to, I don't think, dial back to zero, because at night I will still repeat the game a few times and so on. But it gives me a chance to say, to let go of some of that physical feeling and feel. And you feel this deep understanding. The only game that I can play now is tomorrow's game. And if I mess that up, I've only made it worse for myself. So let's, you know, it's part of the brain coming to terms with that, that your focus now has to be the next game. And this can go into the review ladder for much later, but that's where your focus has got to be. I also used to go to the gym after games and the idea was to exhaust myself so that at night, instead of replaying the game in my head, I would be too tired and actually go to sleep again. I say that good sleep is worth more than all the psychological training and all the other stuff. Not the chest training, but all the other stuff, because nothing like good sleep and good sleep has all these things built into it. If you sleep well, it means that psychologically you're in a good state, you're peaceful enough to your body to switch to something else. With sleep, it means you don't have worries about the next game. It means all those things that you've done things right, and it's almost a compressed form of doing the right thing. So that's the golden mean. And if you can feel in a good mood, generally cheerful, you have friends and family around who make you feel positive, and you do the things that you associate with prior positive experiences, and you don't do the things that went wrong in the past. Even if there's no rational connection, you try to accentuate the positive because invariably these things accumulate.

So I went for a walk with my wife, and my wife normally tries to cheer me up, saying something like, you know, don't worry about it, it'll get better, you know, it's gone better in the past. Something she'll try to say something we both know you can't, you know, take it to the bank, but, you know, you feel a bit better this time.

She said, if you want it. So she said, well, it'll, you know, hang in there, forget about it, and play well. And I told her, yeah, that's all very well, I know that, but it's not.

And then a bit later, we both smiled and we understood that I'm warned up. She's warmed up. It wasn't really happening, but it somehow seemed very funny. And then we went back and funnily enough, it was very helpful because I then decided to start that tournament as if it was starting in the fourth round. So the first three rounds had been a disaster. But what I had understood is I've got to play the next seven rounds whether I like it or not. So you might as well do the best job you can and then go home afterwards and kick yourself in peace.

The dream, of course, is to be well prepared, to know exactly what you're supposed to do. But another way of putting this is that being well prepared is simply an attempt to avoid the worst scenarios. You avoid the worst scenarios by being well prepared. So that then if when you dropped, inevitably, as you will be dropped in an unfamiliar situation, you're able to deal with it confidently. So I'll use language as an analogy. Every chess player plays a part of the game and has expertise in certain parts of the game, like a mother tongue. But then we are constantly trying to add other skills, other parts of the game. And those invariably feel like a second language and a third language where you can learn something, but the application is not that fast. The first line, the mother tongue always feels more fluent. The newer languages, there's always a lag. You'll make mistakes. And even the ability to attempt conversation while not being conscious of your mistakes is a skill. Okay, so. But the dream is to get more and more intuitive, as intuitive as your mother tongue is. In fact, when you speak your mother tongue, you're not thinking of grammatical rules. You just know the next word pops into your head. That's what you're looking for. That's why we train for a year, because we will have a game plan and the technical work will be done fairly fast on paper. But then my thing is to go over that material over and over again. In the context of a game where I don't get any external assistance, I have to figure everything out my own. And only then you understand which are the questions that are blocking you and which are the ones you're able to answer. And then you go with the material once. Okay, now I got it. And then you try again. And then you're going back and forth, back and forth, trying to convert this knowledge into some intuitive understanding, because you cannot. You may control the first 20 moves, even the 23rd move, but sooner or later you'll have to play ten or twelve moves on your own. But those moves are related to the moves that have come before, so they fall into a certain pattern, and you need to familiarize yourself, look at the position over and over again, play many games, and you get that intuitive feeling. And so that's what. But all chess growth is like that for a match. You just do a lot of it because the stakes are very high. But it's the same process everywhere.

And he was multiple times soviet champion. Just after the fall of the Soviet Union, he had emigrated and he was living in Belgium, so I went to have a training camp with him. This is pre computer era. So then we first decided that my main opening, at that point, I should stop playing it. I had come to this conclusion myself, because what I understood was in the opening, that I was most fluent at Kapo was even more fluent, and he was going to be more permanent. So we decided, well, this one is too easy for him, and if it's easy for him, it will turn out to be more easy for him as it goes along. So let's move away and find something where the problems posed are more complex and unfamiliar to him, even at some risk to yourself. So, fairly straightforward strategy. We then made a list of all the positions we would need to study. Very, very small amount of work compared to modern material. Because of the computer, you can generate a lot of stuff. But anyway, we did this work, looked at some systems. I remember I used to have the habit of training until then, but with doing some other things on the side, what we call multitasking. So at some point I asked, I told Misha, there's an episode of Star Trek, so can I leave it on and we'll work? He looked a bit surprised, and I think the sternest voice so far. He told me, if I can leave and come back when the Star Trek is over, but we cannot do two things at palace. So then you see, you know, and I mean, I understood his point, and I thought, it's a pity I'm missing this episode, because not in the days where you can simply replay them anywhere, right? So I kind of understood his point, and I got back to work. And by the way, it's not even, I think, with experience, I would say that my math approach is not totally wrong. Nobody can work 6 hours in a row, so you might want to schedule that break once in a while. That's fair enough, but you could see that that was a big difference. In 2008, we did some of our best work, and I think it's still the best match I played and prepared for very similar situation. I was playing Kramnik this time, and I understood that my main opening is very badly suited to playing against him. The stats were something like, I had beaten him seven times, he had beaten me nine times, but I had beaten him three times with the white pieces and four times with the black pieces. He had beaten me nine times with the white pieces, so he had never beaten me in black, but with white, I was not making any headway. He's a three to one ratio in terms of wins. With black, I was punching a gun. So this suggested an obvious strategy, which is with black, to be aggressive. That was fine. That was always my strategy against him. I just had to build on it. But with White, I understood that my main opening doesn't work against him. He's very good at neutralizing it. Clearly, I feel uncomfortable, very unlike the situation. Kapu would have faced. So, in effect, the suggestion was, well, why don't you switch to a second language? Switch to something you don't play often, where it's not that intuitive. You will be often in unfamiliar situations, but it's harder for him. So once we took this decision, we decided it's not the sort of thing you can spend one month on and then review work. It's a commitment you'd make. Now you decide right away, are you going to go all in or not? So the idea was we would switch and not revisit this decision, no matter how bad it got. So in, we spent some months working on the second opening and played it against Kramnick. And just like a second language, it was often unfamiliar. I would have to think, what would I do now?

This is the world computer championship. And we realized a lot of them are working on laptops, not very. We expected to see a lot of high end hardware, so we asked them, how do we do it? They said, no, I've got the high end hardware at home and we have DC IP protocols that we are running it there, but playing the moves here. And we were amazed because we had never heard of this and it was still not common. Within a year, because of what I did in the match, everyone started doing it. But in a sense, by this chance encounter, we found out about this thing. And so later, when I was preparing for Kramnik, we inquired, can I have access to some very powerful hardware running somewhere else? And some trial and error? But we figured out how to use it. And so we were using this excellent hardware to game all the most risky approaches. I could try and do that match. I'll tell you my routine. There was a flight of stairs 153 steps up over three streets. So my thing was to go to the bottom straight, run up incredibly fast, all 153 steps to exhaustion, then slowly walk down, then again run 153. I was doing this and also sometimes running in the park every morning like a 1 hour thing. We will start at eleven. First eleven till 1230. 1245 was kind of sluggish work. But we are also brainstorming. Can work on this today, that today, whatever. Then lunch break which everyone was looking forward to. We'd go have lunch, but lunch again pleasant. We're all dining, I mean having, ordering together, chatting and then we come back. Then a serious session, three to maybe seven or something like that. That's a big stretch, 4 hours then very important to take a nice walk. By now it's cooled off. So a nice walk then dinner or in the reverse order and come back at nine or 930 and then do one more session till midnight. This we repeated six days a week. 7th day nobody. Everyone slept late, did nothing. One day even, no exercise, just recovery. We did this routine for, I think it was July, August. Then there was a break in September. In October I had a brief review session and then we went off to play the match. So six to eight weeks was the training I used to do. Nowadays the fashion is to do two weeks stop.
